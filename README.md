During HyperionDev's Software Engineering bootcamp, we developed a website for an online shop. 
The objective was to showcase products using Bootstrap features, adhering to a grid system for layout consistency. 
Specifically, we added ten items to the page, ensuring responsive images, clear product names, and prices were displayed. 
Each product was accompanied by a non-functional "buy" button for user interaction. Additionally, we designed a horizontal form to collect customer contact details, although its functionality was not implemented. The website also features a small company logo for branding purposes.
